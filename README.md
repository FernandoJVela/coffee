# Coffee
This is my first prototype for a coffee shop website. In this code I am planning on use some frameworks as angular or react.

The steps to follow are:
1. Introduce the HTML schema
2. Decorate using some CSS properties
3. Give it some logic under JS code
4. Think on DB develop
5. Connect the back using Java or C#

It could be done using some checklist:
- [ ] Introduce the HTML schema
- [ ] Decorate using some CSS properties
- [ ] Give it some logic under JS code
- [ ] Think on DB develop
- [ ] Connect the back using Java or C#

>There are also some design issues to be solved. Mainly the first steps on visual and resources.

Some code example:

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
